<b>My automatic calculators for the Countdown letters and numbers games</b> 

This is my attempt at writing an automatic calculator for the Countdown letters and numbers game.

The project plan is as follows: <br /> 
<i>Phase 1: Backend Calculations</i> (COMPLETED)<br /> 
The first phase of the project wherein the backend calculations are performed correctly is now completed. These procedures may be optimized in future, as the current method is quite inelegant.<br /> 
<i>Phase 2: Game Master</i><br /> 
Add a game master system which allows users to select which game they want to play, give input paramters, and implements timer.<br /> 
<i>Phase 3: Frontend</i><br /> 
Add a frontend to game instead of running from the console.

This project is purely for the purpose of coding practice. Any advice or constructive criticism would be welcomed.
